= Sandbox: Playing around with Concurrency in Kotlin

Concurrency is a hard problem in most languages. Reportedly it's very easy for Erlang developers but most projects I work on it's not easy. This projects plays around with concurrency a bit to better understand it. Look in link:src/test/kotlin[Tests] for some examples.

If you want to see the research I did on concurrency you can check out the file on link:src/main/docs/Concurrency.adoc[Concurrency].

== Getting Started / Demo

`mvn verify`

== Examples
